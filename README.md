## Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core)

### Conceptual Understanding

- **Onion Architecture:** No
- **MVC Pattern:** Yes
- **Web API:** No

### Application & Bottlenecks
#### Onion Architecture

- **Benefits:** Separation of Concerns,Testability,Flexibility and Adaptability,Improved Scalability
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** No, I haven't encountered any bottlenecks with Onion Architecture in my projects.

#### MVC

- **Components:** The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller. The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format. The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** No, I don't because this is my first time exploring the parts of MVC.

#### Web API

- **Differences from MVC:** We can use MVC to create a Web application that responds as both data and views, while the Web API is used to create HTTP services that only respond as data. The Web API request traces with the actions based on the HTTP services, but the MVC request traces with the action name.
- **Bottlenecks (Encountered):** No, I haven't encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs. As I said earlier exploring these two MVC is need such time, effort, and patience.
